# Indexing Voronoi Diagram

## Description
Indexes are used to quickly locate data without having to search every row in a database table every time a database table is accessed. [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_index)

In voronoi diagram, indexing is divided into three methods: vertex, MBR, and center of weight. In this assignment, we'll use vertex indexing. Vertex indexing is an indexing method where every vertex (angular point) in every voronoi cell is indexed to a indexing tree. 

## Instructions
1. Open the voronoi diagram from your last assignment.

![Voronoi Diagram](https://github.com/basisdatalab/research_group/blob/master/assignment/assignment_3/voronoi.png "Voronoi Diagram")

2. Index those diagram using indexing algorithm. (You're free to choose any indexing algorithm, but Quad Tree is reccomended as you've learnt it in the last research).
3. Create the indexing tree based on your voronoi diagram.
4. Save the indexed voronoi diagram and the indexing tree to your corresponding Student Number folder inside the assignment_3 folder.
5. Do the pull request.
